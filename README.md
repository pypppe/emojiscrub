# About
Emojiscrub is a fun web-game where you are shown emojis, e.g. "🛍️🎯", and that emoji has an answer. (So the answer would be Target).
And you have to guess it correctly. Look above the emojis for hints. (or just look at the code.)

# Data Management
We collect 0 data. We don't know your IP, Country, house location, etc...
We don't even know what you do on the website.

but.. *why*?
Well, it's because we wanna be the #1 company in the UK that *Doesnt* take data from anyone.
